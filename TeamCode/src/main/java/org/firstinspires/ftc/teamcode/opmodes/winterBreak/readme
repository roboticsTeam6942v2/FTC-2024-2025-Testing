i will likely be doing this so this is just note for me

first set lift, foot, and elbow to their middle positions (basically so if they spin any direction it wont break anything
then run the code, the mode should read "directional"
use the dpad to change motors and test each one by pressing 'a'. Any that need to be reversed can be changed in the constants file
change 'directionIsSetup' on line 17 to true
