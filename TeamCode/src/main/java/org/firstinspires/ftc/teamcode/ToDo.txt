Make runnable for the end of RTP for Drivetrains and Manipulators, try to not make it taxing
Fix parameters to be more clear ex. Instead of m or p, write motor or power
Make parallel motor linkage class
Figure out odometry and then entirely rewrite the drivetrains
Figure up trapazoidal powering stuff, to ramp up and down power to fix roadrunner-ing
Rewrite all the drivetrains a third time because theres 2 approaches to odemetry
