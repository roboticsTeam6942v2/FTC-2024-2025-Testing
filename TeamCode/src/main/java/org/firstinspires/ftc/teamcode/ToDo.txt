Make runnable for the end of RTP for Drivetrains and Manipulators, try to not make it taxing
Figure out odometry and then entirely rewrite the drivetrains
Figure up trapazoidal powering stuff, to ramp up and down power to fix roadrunner-ing
Rewrite all the drivetrains a third time because theres 2 approaches to odemetry
Fix drivetrain variables for clarity

Maybe make CR servo, but then again you can just take advantage of how a CR servo works, and use .5 as the position to go stay, and just go up and down from there. Also CR servo is just basically dcmotorsimple anyways
